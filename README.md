PsychoPy v2022.2.5
Python 3.9.21
This repo gives you 2 scripts, one for stroop task and one for n-back task illustrated in Chinese.
Experiment time, reaction time, introduction language, 2/3/4/n-back and other key elements can be adjusted.
Well, I'm new in coding and this is my very first creating my own repo here thus I don't really know should be included in this readme and the repo. 
So, I just add the 2 scripts and the verision of pschopy and python.
Wish it can help you to create your own psychological or biological experiment!
